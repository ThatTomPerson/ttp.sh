  <p>Hey 👋 I'm Tom, I am a Web Developer based in Adelaide, Australia 🌏.</p>

  <p>I have diverse skills in Javascript, PHP, Docker, and many AWS services.</p>

  <p>
    My current favourite pass time is playing around with the <a target="_blank" href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a> for personal projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a gamer, skiier, amateur cook, and coffee addict.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can go and check out some of my <a href="#projects">Projects</a> that I have worked on, and if you would like me to work on a website for you please feel free to <a href="#contact-me">contact me</a> and we can catch up over a coffee ☕.

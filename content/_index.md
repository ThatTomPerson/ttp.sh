Hey :wave: I'm Tom, I am a Web Developer based in Adelaide, Australia :earth_asia:.

I have diverse skills in Javascript, PHP, Docker, and many AWS services.

My current favourite pass time is playing around with the [Serverless](http://serverless.com/) for personal projects.

I'm a gamer, skiier, amateur cook, and coffee addict.

You can go and check out some of my [Projects](#projects) that I have worked on, and if you would like me to work on a website for you please feel free to [contact me](#contact-me) and we can catch up over a coffee.
